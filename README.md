🏭 Quality Control System 🔍


📸 Project Overview

The Quality Control System is an advanced AI-powered defect detection and prediction system for smart manufacturing. It uses Machine Learning (ML) and Data Analytics to identify defect patterns, enhance quality assurance, and provide real-time insights via an interactive dashboard.

This system helps manufacturers reduce production defects, increase efficiency, and optimize quality control in industrial processes.

📱 Quality Control System App
🔍 What We Have Built
We have developed a real-time Quality Control System that can analyze defects in manufactured products using Machine Learning algorithms. The app provides instant defect detection, trend analysis, and predictive insights to help industries improve product quality and reduce waste.

This system was developed using:
✔️ Python for data processing and ML model training
✔️ Streamlit for an interactive, real-time dashboard
✔️ PostgreSQL for efficient data storage
✔️ Power BI for advanced analytics and visualization

💡 What This App Can Do
✅ Live Defect Monitoring: The system continuously tracks and categorizes defects in production.
✅ AI-Powered Defect Detection: Uses a Random Forest Classifier to analyze defect patterns and provide real-time predictions.
✅ Data-Driven Insights: Displays trend analysis and anomaly detection to prevent quality issues.
✅ Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes defects, trends, and product quality metrics using charts and graphs.
✅ Automated Quality Reports: Generates reports with historical defect data for better decision-making.
✅ Scalable & Adaptable: Can be integrated with IoT sensors for real-time industrial monitoring.


🚀 Features
✔️ Real-Time Defect Analysis – Instantly detects and categorizes defects in manufactured products.
✔️ AI-Powered Predictions – Uses Machine Learning to classify defects and suggest improvements.
✔️ User-Friendly Dashboard – Interactive Streamlit app with clear charts and visualizations.
✔️ Automated Reports – Generates detailed defect analysis reports for manufacturers.
✔️ Secure Data Storage – Saves data efficiently in PostgreSQL for long-term analysis.
✔️ Easy Integration – Can be connected to IoT sensors and production machines for real-time tracking.
